Prefix Sum : Useful for Range Queries.

Prefix sum formula : prefSum[i] = prefSum[i - 1] + A[i] =========================== TC for N Natural Numbers = O(N)

Sum of [L - R] =>
    if L == 0 => psum(R)
        else psum(R) - psum (L-1)

Issues in PrefixSum like Why we don't modify given array to create prefixSum/cumulative sum.
1. Given array is Integer & pf can be Long as array element can be 10^9 and its sum will be > 10^9 like it can be 10^14 which is Long.
Both Integer & Long is not same, not possible to modify given array. Even we can't typecast as Long to Integer can be overflow.

The equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes.
